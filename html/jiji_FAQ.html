                <h3><a class="h3_faq" href="#">Where do your coffee beans come from?</a></h3>  <!--href = # will scroll a page to the top-->
                <div class="faq_div">
                    <p>
                        All of our beans are sourced from growers in California and are shipped whole to be ground in store, 
                        so your coffee has that fresh, rich taste we are known for, every time.
                    </p>

                <h3><a class="h3_faq" href="#">Can I volunteer in the store and for events?</a></h3>
                <div class="faq_div">

                        Yes! We welcome volunteers and would love to review your application.
                        Please send an application to <a href="mailto: jijis.beans@gmail.com">jijis.beans@gmail.com</a>.

                <h3><a class="h3_faq" href="#">How long will it take for my adoption application to go through?</a></h3>
                <div class="faq_div">
                    <p>
                        It depends on which shelter the cat is being adopted through. Most applications do not take
                        longer than a week to go through, so expect a response within that time frame.
                    </p>

                <h3><a class="h3_faq" href="#">Can I bring my cat to visit with your feline residents?</a></h3>
                <div class="faq_div">
                    <p>
                        For the safety of our cats, we ask that you do not bring in any outside animals. Thank you!
                    </p>

                <h3><a class="h3_faq" href="#">What medical care have the cats received?</a></h3>
                <div class="faq_div">
                    <p>
                        Our residents are up to date with all required vaccinations, and all of our adult residents 
                        (1 year and older) have been spayed or neutered. Additionally, we have them regularly tested
                        for parasites, and all of them have been treated for fleas and ticks.
