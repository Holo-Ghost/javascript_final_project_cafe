            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We first opened our doors in 2021 with the goal of creating a space where cat and coffee lovers could
                relax and unite under one roof, while also providing an opportunity to find local cats their forever homes!
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, we have sent over 50 cats to a loving home, and have provided food, litter, and medical supplies
                to shelters in our area from donations from people just like you.
            </p>
            <p>
                20% of profits made from selling food and drink, and 100% of donations go towards helping shelter animals and our 
                residents. We regularly host fundraisers and adoption events in hopes of helping our fuzzy friends in need! We encourage 
                everyone to attend these events and support our community.
            </p>
